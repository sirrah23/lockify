# Lockify

Lockify is a simple web application that generates, and lets you keep track, of
locker codes.

Check it out [here](https://lockify.vercel.app/) (while supplies last).

## Background

I go to the gym often  üèãÔ∏èÔ∏è and mine in particular has lockers that anyone can
use. You just have to punch in a code to lock your stuff. I like to use random
codes instead of using the same one all the time, but it's annoying to have to
divine a 4 digit code each time, and to then write it down somewhere so I don't
forget it. This app exists to facilitate this process.


## Technical stuff

### Implementation details

All codes are generated in the browser and all data is stored client-side. There
is no backend üôÄ
